I worked on a project using NopCommerce, a free online e-commerce platform, to learn and implement the Cucumber framework. In this project, I focused on the following functionalities:

Creating a user account
Searching for an item
Adding the item to the cart
Completing the checkout process
This hands-on experience helped me gain a deeper understanding of both the e-commerce domain and the Cucumber framework for behavior-driven development (BDD)."
